## _VERY IMPORTANT_ READ IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO START A FASTAPI SERVER

### INSTRUCTIONS:

1. To begin booting up the python server, use 'venv/Scripts/activate'

2. At the start of the virtual environment, all dependencies may not be installed: run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

3. Start the server with 'uvicorn main:app --reload', the '--reload' flag ensures that the dev server will be restarted when the file is saved
